# MNIST using Triton to accelerate things

üéØ Implement TRITON JIT parts to go FAST based on https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/blob/main/python/tutorials/02-fused-softmax.py

üî¢ Results:

Currently trying to follow the tutorials but the code isn't working - I suspect it has something to do with either the fact that I'm using a T4 that doesn't have enough lines or something. Have to check in tomorrow when I'll have more time.

üß© Key Learnings:


    - Triton was initially optimized only for CUDA kernels. It seems that it's expanding out to AMD as CDNA is mentioned along with HIP.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced:

    Seems that package versioning is giving me a tough time again. The example program doesn't seem to work correctly either, I'll have to investigate further. VSCODE gave me a tough time to set up as well which was a pain (problem with the python extension on the SSH of GCP)

üõ†Ô∏è Improvements for Tomorrow

    Run the sample code and compare with my implementation
